## Code Review Link

This code review provides an overview of the original artifact before enhancements. It walks through the existing functionality, highlights areas for improvement, and explains the planned modifications. The review also demonstrates how I approached analyzing structure, efficiency, and security to prepare for enhancements that align with professional standards and course outcomes.

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

**Artifact:** Final mobile application developed in Android Studio.  

**Original Skills Demonstrated:**  
- User-centered design  
- Object-oriented programming (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Frontend-backend integration  

**Enhancements:**  
- Improved UI/UX design for accessibility and usability  
- Added error handling and input validation  
- Implemented security checks for user authentication and data handling  
- Documented code and design decisions
