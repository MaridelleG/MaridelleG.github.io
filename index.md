# Welcome!
Hello. My name is Maridelle Gonzales and this is my site in partial fulfillment of my capstone. Enjoy!

## Code Review Link
This code review provides an overview of the original artifact before enhancements. It walks through the existing functionality, highlights areas for improvement, and explains the planned modifications. The review also demonstrates how I approached analyzing structure, efficiency, and security to prepare for enhancements that align with professional standards and course outcomes.

## Enhancement One  
**Software Design and Algorithms** 

The first artifact selected for enhancement is my final mobile application developed in Android Studio. The original project already showcased important skills such as user-centered design, object-oriented programming principles (encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism), and the integration of frontend UI with backend logic. For the enhancement, I improved the UI/UX design to make the application more accessible and user-friendly, implemented additional error handling and input validation, and introduced security checks for user authentication and data handling. I also documented the code and design decisions to demonstrate adherence to software engineering best practices.
