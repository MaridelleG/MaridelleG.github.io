## Code Review Link

This code review provides an overview of the original artifact before enhancements. It walks through the existing functionality, highlights areas for improvement, and explains the planned modifications. The review also demonstrates how I approached analyzing structure, efficiency, and security to prepare for enhancements that align with professional standards and course outcomes.

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

**Artifact:** Final mobile application developed in Android Studio.  

**Original Skills Demonstrated:**  
- User-centered design  
- Object-oriented programming (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Frontend-backend integration  

**Enhancements:**  
- Improved UI/UX design for accessibility and usability  
- Added error handling and input validation  
- Implemented security checks for user authentication and data handling  
- Documented code and design decisions

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Sctructure  

**Artifact:** Course management system implemented in C++ using unordered_map and vector.  

**Original Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Use of hash tables for efficient data access
- Implementation of sorting algorithms and structured data handling
- File I/O and processing of tab-separated course data

**Enhancements:**  
- Added topological sorting to manage course prerequisites
- Implemented graph data structures to visualize dependencies
- Included unit tests to validate correctness of algorithms
- Optimized memory usage and enhanced error handling

## Enhancement Three: Databases

**Artifact:** Pet Check-In/Check-Out pseudocode and flowchart. 

**Original Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Object-oriented design applied to data modeling
- Logical structuring of data and operations for pet management
- Application of encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism

**Enhancements:**  
- Integrated file-based database operations with object-oriented design.
- Added search functionality for pets by name.
- Added update functionality to modify pet data
- Added reporting to view all currently boarded pets.
- Linked OOP concepts to database-like operations
